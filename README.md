# 🚀 AutoHost CLI

**Take back control of your services.**  
**AutoHost CLI** is a command-line tool to install, configure, and manage applications and services **on your own server**, without depending on third parties and with a simple and automated workflow.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **One-command installation**: Deploy ready-to-use applications with `app install`.
- **Multi-app support**: Nextcloud, BookStack, Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more (constantly growing!).
- **Tailscale integration**: Securely connect to your private infrastructure.
- **Docker compatibility**: Isolation and portability for your applications.
- **Privacy and control focus**: Everything runs on **your** infrastructure.

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have:
- A **Linux**-based system (compatible with modern distributions like Ubuntu/Debian).  
- **Docker** installed and running.  
- Administrator permissions (**sudo/root**).  
- Optional: **Tailscale** account if you want to enable secure private access.  

---

## 📦 Installation

Install AutoHost CLI directly from GitHub with a single command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mazapanuwu13/autohost-cli/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This script automatically detects your operating system and architecture, downloads the latest binary version from GitHub Releases, and installs AutoHost CLI on your system.

## 🛠 Basic Usage

### Example workflow

```bash
# Initialize environment
autohost init

# Initial setup (domain, networks, etc.)
autohost setup

# Install an application (example: Nextcloud)
autohost app install

# List installed applications
autohost app ls

# Start the application
autohost app start nextcloud

# Check app status
autohost app status nextcloud

# Stop the application
autohost app stop nextcloud

# Remove an application
autohost app remove nextcloud
```

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with the following structure:

```

├── cmd/                    # CLI commands (Cobra)
├── internal/
│   ├── adapters/          # External integrations (Docker, Caddy, Tailscale, etc.)
│   │   └── storage/       # Database repositories (SQLite)
│   ├── app/               # Application services (business logic)
│   ├── domain/            # Domain models and interfaces
│   └── platform/          # Platform utilities (config, DI, filesystem)
├── db/                    # Database migrations and seeds
├── assets/                # Embedded templates (docker-compose files)
├── utils/                 # Utility functions
└── scripts/               # Installation and testing scripts
```

### Key Components

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and service orchestration
- **Adapters Layer**: External integrations (Docker, Caddy, Tailscale, CloudFlare, etc.)
- **Infrastructure**: Database, configuration, and platform-specific code

## 🧪 Testing Environment

### Multipass VM for Testing

You need to have **Multipass** installed: https://canonical.com/multipass

| Command                              | Description                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `scripts/autohost-multipass.sh run`    | Creates VM (autohost-test) with autohost binary in bin folder |
| `scripts/autohost-multipass.sh update` | Updates autohost binary in VM (autohost-test) bin folder      |
| `scripts/autohost-multipass.sh delete` | Deletes the VM (autohost-test)                                |
